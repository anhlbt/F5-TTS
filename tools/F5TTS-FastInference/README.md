# 🎙️ F5TTS (Modified)

**F5TTS** has been modified to **stream audio as it's generated**, instead of waiting for the entire inference to complete. This allows for much faster and more interactive voice feedback.

## 🎞️ Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for audio handling.

Download it from:  
🔗 [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)

- Extract the files
- Add the `bin/` folder to your system’s `PATH` environment variable

## ⚙️ CUDA Toolkit DLLs

To ensure GPU acceleration works properly, additional DLLs might be needed.

1. Download the precompiled **CUDA DLLs** from:  
   🔗 [https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/libs](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/libs)

2. Extract the contents directly into the root folder of the cloned repository.

## ✅ You're Ready!

Run the main script and F5TTS will now generate and play speech **on-the-fly**, chunk by chunk — no more waiting for the full audio to render before playback.
